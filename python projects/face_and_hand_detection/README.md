*FEACTURES:<br>
This Python project showcases a real-time face and hand detection system, <br>
  built using powerful libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe.<br> The system accurately detects and tracks facial features and hand landmarks in video streams.<br>
  By leveraging the flexibility of MediaPipe, you can customize the detection thresholds to balance sensitivity and accuracy.<br>
  The potential applications of this technology are vast, ranging from facial recognition and hand gesture recognition to human-computer interaction and video analysis.
